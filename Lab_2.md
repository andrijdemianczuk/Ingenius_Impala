# Lab 2: Dashboarding
Dashboarding can be deceptively simple. Since dashboards are often the point of interface with users and downstream consumers we need to be conscientious of how they are used. Remember that when we create perspectives of our data they are often with a focus or intent in mind. Try to maintain the focus of the dashboard and the 'story' that it tells.

1. Try to use the data explorer to add data sources and visualizations with data from the existing two datasources. Try some different data points to tell a 'story' in a way that a user might find useful to analyze.<br/><br/>
1. Try creating some more views and rerun the pipeline. Views are re-computed with every pipeline update but have the downstream advantage of being highly performant, especially with dashboards running on serverless resources.<br/><br/>
1. Try leveraging AI-assisted BI tools. When you add a visualization try leveraging the Databricks AI assistant to build some insights.<br/><br/>
1. Try playing around with the refresh scheduler and running updates for your pipelines. How does newly updated data make it's way to your dashboard?
